Loan Tracker for Shopkeepers is a backend API service built to help small business owners like kirana storekeepers, tailors, and hardware shop owners manage customer credit transactions. The system allows shopkeepers to register and log in securely, add customers, record loans (credit sales), track repayments (including partial payments), and receive alerts for overdue paymentsâ€”all in a simple, digital format to replace traditional notebooks.
